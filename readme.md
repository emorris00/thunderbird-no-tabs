# No Tabs

Hides the tab bar and automatically removes all inactive tabs everytime a tab is opened or switched to.

# Known Issues

There are some small bugs like if you have messages set to open in a new tab then when looking at a message you can't go directly back to the inbox. Also attempting to open messages in a new tab from the context menu will do nothing.
